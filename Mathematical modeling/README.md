My programs for subject "Mathematical modeling". I used Qt and C++.
1) Modeling the motion of satellites around the Earth.

This program shows the orbital motion of a constellation of satellites around the Earth. The main task was to simulate the rotation of the satellites around their own axis. 3 lines near each satellite show the axes of the satellite.

2) Finding the minimum of a function.

The program searches for a minimum using the particle swarm algorithm and its variations (freezing, extinction, genetic and others) and visualizes its working at each step.
