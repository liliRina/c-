My course work by subject "Mathematical modeling"
1) Modeling the motion of satellites around the Earth.

This program shows the orbital motion of a constellation of satellites around the Earth. The main task was to simulate the rotation of the satellites around their own axis. 3 lines near each satellite show the axes of the satellite.
